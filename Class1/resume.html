    <h2 style="color: rgb(94, 66, 24);"><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Muhammd Rial, born on <mark><strong>12<sup>th</sup> july,1997</strong></mark>. I am a passionate chemist with a keen interest in industrial applications of chemicals. I graduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Dhaka and have over five years of experience in the field.<br><br>

    One of my favorite compounds to work with is sulfuric acid <mark><strong>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub></strong></mark>. Did you know that sulfuric acid is one of the most widely produced chemicals in the world? It's used in a variety of applications, from manufacturing fertilizers to refining petroleum12. Despite its many uses, it's important to handle it with care due to its highly corrosive nature. <br><br>
    When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy hiking, reading science fiction novels, and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my portfolio to learn more about my work and projects.</p><br>
